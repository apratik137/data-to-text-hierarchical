The New Year 's Eve showdown between the two Central Division rivals was atypical in a number of ways .

Orlando has lost three straight , and while they have tons of talent on their roster , it looks like the Magic will be focusing on development this season instead of fighting for a playoff spot .

Jimmy Butler ( hamstring ) was originally ruled out but was given the green light by coach Jason Kidd to come off the bench and play limited minutes . Orlando has lost three of their last four games , as they were playing through a stretch that saw them facing off against the top teams in the Eastern Conference .

He put up just eight points in 16 minutes Wednesday , but he was in the starting lineup to begin overtime , showing how highly coach Gregg Popovich thinks of Mills . Danny Green was the high scorer for the Spurs , finishing with 19 points and eight rebounds in 31 minutes . Detroit has won three straight games . They 'll go on the road to face the Denver Nuggets on Saturday . Detroit has lost seven of their last eight games .

Tiago Splitter moved into the starting lineup for the first time in his career . Leonard finished with eight points , six rebounds and one assist in 28 minutes . The Spurs will return to action Friday when they host the Nets . Detroit was coming off extended rest Wednesday , having last played Saturday against Washington . The rest did n't translate to a favorable result , however , as the Pistons dropped their fourth straigh game . The current losing streak makes Detroit 's playoff chances tenable at best as Indiana , Brooklyn , and Boston are all ahead of the Pistons . The Pistons will look to snap their losing skid Friday in Houston .
