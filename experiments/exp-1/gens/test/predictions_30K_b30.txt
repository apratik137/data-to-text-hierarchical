The New Year 's Eve showdown between the two Central Division rivals was atypical in a number of ways .

The Wizards had entered Thursday 's contest sporting an impressive 10 - 6 home record and playing quality basketball overall . Meanwhile , Washington had managed a paltry three wins in 21 tries away from the Bradley Center , including consecutive road losses to the Mavericks and Thunder preceding Thursday 's game .

He said he could have played if the game was a must - win but that it 's more important to make sure he does n't injure himself further at this time of the season . Evan Fournier started at point guard and finished with 13 points and two assists in 40 minutes . Orlando has lost three straight , and while they have tons of talent on their roster , it looks like the Magic will be focusing on development this season instead of fighting for a playoff spot . It 's obvious watching the team that they are improving under coach Quin Snyder , so time and experience will be the test to see if the Magic have the right guys to build a winning team around . Jimmy Butler ( hamstring ) was originally ruled out but was given the green light by coach Jason Kidd to come off the bench and play limited minutes . Orlando is on a back - to - back set . Evan Fournier sat out a second straight game with an ankle bruise . They had just one starter finish in double digits , but four bench players were able to crack the threshold .

The San Antonio Spurs ( 34 - 19 ) defeated the Detroit Pistons ( 21 - 33 ) 104 - 87 on Wednesday . San Antonio has won two of their last four as they seem to be finally adapating to playing without Kawhi Leonard ( hand ) and Tony Parker ( hamstring ) who remain sidelined indefinitely . The return of Patty Mills from shoulder surgery three games ago has given them more help off the bench and more scoring . He put up just eight points in 16 minutes Wednesday , but he was in the starting lineup to begin overtime , showing how highly coach Gregg Popovich thinks of Mills . Danny Green was the high scorer for the Spurs , finishing with 19 points and eight rebounds in 31 minutes . Detroit has won three straight games . They 'll go on the road to face the Denver Nuggets on Saturday . Detroit has lost seven of their last eight games . While they are traversing a rather difficult part of their schedule , the Pistons ' regression over the last two weeks seems more of a regression to the mean than merely a poor stretch . Tiago Splitter moved into the starting lineup for the first time in his career . Leonard finished with eight points , six rebounds and one assist in 28 minutes . The Spurs will return to action Friday when they host the Nets . Detroit was coming off extended rest Wednesday , having last played Saturday against Washington . The rest did n't translate to a favorable result , however , as the Pistons dropped their fourth straigh game . The current losing streak makes Detroit 's playoff chances tenable at best as Indiana , Brooklyn , and Boston are all ahead of the Pistons . The Pistons will look to snap their losing skid Friday in Houston .

Miles was right behind him with 17 points , six assists , a rebound and a steal . Dwight Howard was next with a 14 - point , 17 - rebound double - double that also included two assists and a block . Solomon Hill paced the reserves with 13 points , three assists , three rebounds and two steals .
