The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the New York Knicks , 121 - 107 , at Madison Square Garden on Monday night . The Knicks ( 22 - 31 ) have been mired in controversy on and off the court in recent weeks , with rumors swirling about a possible trade of franchise cornerstone Carmelo Anthony and losses in three of their last four games . The Lakers ( 18 - 36 ) are n't in much better shape , however , and came into Monday 's contest with only five road wins in 28 games away from the Staples Center this season . However , a sterling effort from the Los Angeles bench that generated over half of the team 's scoring total helped lead the way to a relatively easy victory .

The power forward out of Kentucky was great in 32 minutes off the bench , scoring 18 points on 6 - of - 12 shooting . Gordon Hayward , who has been unstoppable as of late with five straight games of at least 20 points , struggled mightily , shooting just 4 - of - 14 from the field and 1 - of - 7 from behind the arc en route to just 13 points . With Favors potentially out for an indefinite amount of time , the burden will be on Hayward to regain his scoring mojo and carry the load for a Utah team that is n't very prolific offensively . Up next , the Grizzlies will head to Los Angeles on Wednesday to take on the red - hot Clippers , while the Jazz will have off until Thursday when they take on Chicago at home .
